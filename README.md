# Letters to My Son About Code

Hi, my son. 👋

This is a collection of simple code problems and explanations,  
written so that even a 10-year-old (or anyone!) could understand them.  
Not just *what* the code is — but *why* it works.

Because coding isn't magic.  
It's just small steps that build big things.

I hope this helps you — and maybe some other kids, and dads, and families too.

— ❤️ Dad.
